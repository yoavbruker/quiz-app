## Create-React-App-Lambda

This project is a reference demo showing you how to use [Create React App v3](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app) and [netlify-lambda v1](https://github.com/netlify/netlify-lambda) together in a [Netlify Dev](https://www.netlify.com/docs/cli/?utm_source=github&utm_medium=swyx-CRAL&utm_campaign=devex#netlify-dev-beta) workflow. You can clone this and immediately be productive with a React app with serverless Netlify Functions in the same repo. Alternatively you can deploy straight to Netlify with this one-click Deploy:

[![Deploy to Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/img/deploy/button.svg?utm_source=github&utm_medium=swyx-CRAL&utm_campaign=devex)](https://app.netlify.com/start/deploy?repository=https://github.com/netlify/create-react-app-lambda&utm_source=github&utm_medium=swyx-CRAL&utm_campaign=devex)

> ⚠️NOTE: You may not need this project at all. [Netlify Dev](https://github.com/netlify/netlify-dev-plugin) works with `create-react-app` out of the box! Only
